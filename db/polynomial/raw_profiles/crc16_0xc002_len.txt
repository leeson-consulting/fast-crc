# The 0x8005 16 polynomial in normal notation is the bit-reversed equivalent of the 0xa001 polynomial in Koopman notation.
#
# 0x8005 is widely referred to in Greg Cook's CRC catalogue in terms of algorithms using non-reversed inputs.
# However Philip Koopman lists 0x8005 as a reversed polynomial in his CRC Zoo.
#
# In order to keep the peace, I've elected to duplicate the 0xa001 Hamming Profile here.

0x8005 {32751,32751}
